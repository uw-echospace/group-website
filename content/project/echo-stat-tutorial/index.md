For a 2018 tutorial I published with
[Tim Stanton](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/tstanton/) and
[Kyungmin Baik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyungmin-baik-098156149/) in
the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA):

**Echo statistics associated with discrete scatterers: A tutorial on physics-based methods**. JASA 144(6): 3124â€“3171; https://doi.org/10.1121/1.5052255

we provided the Matlab code to reproduce all figures in two forms:

- a _frozen_ version archived with the paper, and
- a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/leewujung/echo-stats-tutorial) minted with a [DOI from Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2458776).

This way we can keep the code "alive" on GitHub but also has a convenient snapshot of the code at the time of the tutorial publication.
