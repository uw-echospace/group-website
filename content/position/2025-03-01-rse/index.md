## Open-Source Software to Accelerate Marine Ecosystem Research

The [Echospace](https://uw-echospace.github.io/) research group at the University of Washington, Seattle is seeking a highly motivated individual to contribute to the development of cutting-edge software tools for marine ecosystem research. This position offers the opportunity to work on "[Echostack](https://doi.org/10.25080/WXRH8633)", a suite of open-source Python software packages designed to process and analyze large-scale echosounder data.

Echosounders are high-frequency ocean sonar systems widely used to [study life in the ocean](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e245977def474bdba60952f30576908f). By transmitting sounds and analyzing the echoes bounced off fish and zooplankton, echosounders “image” the underwater world much like how medical ultrasound images the interior of the human body, providing crucial insights into marine ecosystems. By joining this project, you will play a key role in making echosounder data more accessible and useful for researchers worldwide.


### What you’ll do
- Design, develop, and test open-source software for processing and analyzing large volumes of echosounder data
- Optimize and benchmark software performance on local computers and cloud virtual machines
- Process and analyze archived echosounder data spanning over 20 years, collected by NOAA and other US institutions
- Build and manage near real-time data workflows from research cruises


### Who we’re looking for
We welcome applications from recent graduates, post-baccalaureate researchers, advanced undergraduates, or current master’s students with the following qualifications:
- A solid foundation in software engineering
- Proficiency with object-oriented programming, particularly in Python
- Experience with or a strong interest in large datasets and distributed computing
- Completion of a college level linear algebra course
- Commitment to learn echosounder data processing procedures and data structures
- A strong interest in ocean science, environmental science, or related fields
- Excellent communication skills to work effectively in an interdisciplinary team of researchers with backgrounds in engineering, mathematics, and biology

Note this position is intended for early career professionals or students. The initial appointment will be 3-6 months with a possibility of extension. The exact position setup will vary depending on your status. 


### Why join us?
This is an excellent opportunity to:
- Develop open-source software that directly contributes to ocean research
- Gain experience in scientific computing, cloud computing, and environmental data science
- Work closely with researchers at the University of Washington, NOAA, and other institutions
- Build your technical portfolio and establish connections in the ocean technology and research community
