I am a student at the University of Washington majoring in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology with a minor in Environmental Science and Resource Management. I am expected to graduate in the spring of 2023 and hope to one day attend graduate school to further my research. 

I am particularly interested in molecular ecology and population genetics of vulnerable species, and the effect climate change and human development will have on these populations. I am an avid outdoorswoman, and when you can't find me in the lab I am usually hiking, camping, or birdwatching!

At Echospace, I am part of a team that studies local bat populations using bioacoustic data to better understand social and foraging behavior of bats.  

I am available via email, and happy to answer any questions you may have.
