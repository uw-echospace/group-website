Hi, I’m **Shivam Agarwal**—a Research Software Engineer at the University of Washington’s Applied Physics Laboratory.  
I build and maintain the open-source **`echodata`** libraries, the Python backbone that turns raw echosounder files into tidy, analysis-ready datasets for large-scale marine-acoustic research.

**What I do**

* Design modular, well-tested APIs that let scientists stream terabytes of multibeam and split-beam data—from laptops to cloud clusters—in just a few lines of code.  
* Profile and optimize signal-processing kernels so batch jobs finish hours faster and storage costs drop.  
* Harden CI/CD pipelines, write contributor docs, and triage issues to keep the community moving quickly.

Acoustic sensing uncovers hidden ocean dynamics—from krill layers in the Southern Ocean to migrating whales off the Pacific Northwest. By making data access and computation frictionless, `echodata` helps researchers extract ecological insight sooner while containing both carbon and cloud spend.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate, request a feature, or simply chat about open-source science.
