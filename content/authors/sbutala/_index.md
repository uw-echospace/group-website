I will be working on the echoflow project over the summer. [Echoflow](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echoflow), an open source project, aims to orchestrate the echopype data processing functions to ease the ability to process cloud-based/local data through a sequence of functions. Echoflow will be developed in parallel with the ongoing development of [echopype](https://echopype.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#), which handles the standardization, preprocessing and organization of echo data.
