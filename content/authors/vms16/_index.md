I am a Senior Data Scientist and Data Science Fellow at the eScience Institute, Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington. As part of my role I collaborate with researchers from a wide range of domains on extracting information from large data sets of various modalities, such as time series, images, videos, audio, text, etc. I am involved in data science education for audiences at broad level of experience, and regularly teach workshops on introductory and advanced topics. I support open science and reproducible research, and strive to help others adopt better data science workflows.

# Research Interests:
* Image Analysis
* Time Series Analysis
* Machine Learning for Ocean Acoustics
* Large Scale Computing
* Reproducible Research Workflows
* Data Science for Social Good
