I am a student at the University of Washington studying Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Embedded Computing Systems. I hope to graduate from the University of Washington in Spring/Fall of 2022. I enjoy programming and working with others to create better software.

I am pursuing that passion in my position as a Student Assistant at the Applied Physics Laboratory where I am helping to develop [Echopype](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype), a tool for working with sonar data. Although I do not have much experience with acoustics, I enjoy  learning more about this field every day.

Other topics I am interested in are networking and server-side development. I am familiar with Python and Rust.
