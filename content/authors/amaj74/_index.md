I am a student at the University of Washington currently majoring in Mechanical Engineering with an expected graduation date in Spring of 2027. I have previously studied biology, and I enjoy connecting it with mechanical design to see them come together to create more efficient and innovative results. 

I do not have much prior experience with acoustics, but I am excited to learn about the subject as well as develop new skills. At Echospace, I am assisting with audio recorder deployments in the Union Bay Natural Area as well as with deployment of a microphone array to record bats.
