We are an interdisciplinary research group focused on extracting insights from large ocean acoustic datasets, which contain rich information from zooplankton, fish, to whales. 
Our work combines physics-based models with data-driven methods to develop computational tools and open-source software to analyze [water column sonar data](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e245977def474bdba60952f30576908f).
We also study echolocating bats and toothed whales as biological models for adaptive sonar sensing.

### Research areas:
- Acoustical oceanography
- Machine learning in ocean acoustics
- Fisheries acoustics
- Animal echolocation / bioacoustics
- Data systems and workflows
