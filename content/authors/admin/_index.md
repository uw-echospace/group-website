Our research focuses on active acoustic sensing by humans (machines) and animals.
We integrate physics-based models with data-driven methods to extract information from large ocean acoustic datasets, and study echolocating bats and toothed whales as biological models for adaptive sonar sensing.
In parallel, we develop open-source software and host hands-on workshops to engage and empower the community in advancing acoustic sensing technology.

### Research areas:
- Acoustical oceanography
- Fisheries acoustics
- Animal echolocation / bioacoustics
- Machine learning in ocean acoustics
- Scientific computing and software
