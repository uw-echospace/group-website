I am a research assistant focused on the ADCP (Acoustic Doppler current profiler). I enjoy doing experiments and learning about acoustics. I had some experience with Python programming and I want to learn more. I earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in applied physics from the University of Washington in 2021. I want to try out different fields, and I hope to return to school for a master's degree.
