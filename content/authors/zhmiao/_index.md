I work on problems in wildlife conservation and environmental science using big data with high structural
complexity (e.g., wildlife imagery data, accelerometer data, and audio data) and state-of-the-art artificial
intelligence methods (e.g., computer vision and deep learning). The goal is to address large-scale
environmental issues that are not achievable with conventional ecological methods and monitor species
responses to climate changes. My research also serves as a bridge between applied computer / data
science and ecological / environmental research.


My primary responsibilities within the group include: 
   * The development of algorithms for automatic fish recognition through echosounder imagery
