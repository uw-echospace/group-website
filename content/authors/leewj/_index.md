Sound is the best information carrier in the ocean. I work at the intersection of physics, engineering, and biology to develop computational methods, models, and interpretation frameworks to extract biological information from ocean acoustic data. 

My current research focuses on integrating physics-based models and data-driven methods to address two fundamental aspects of acoustic sensing:

* **Sampling** – how do we collect better data?
* **Inference** – what can we learn from the data?

A parallel but closely related focus of my research involves using echolocating bats and toothed whales as biological models for adaptive ocean sensing.

I am an active contributor to open-source scientific software (see [Echostack](https://proceedings.scipy.org/articles/WXRH8633)) and am passionate about education. I founded and continue to co-lead [OceanHackWeek](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/), a workshop dedicated to data science in oceanography, since 2018, and served on the National Academies committee on [Ocean Acoustics Education and Expertise](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/ocean-acoustics-education-and-expertise) in 2023-2024.

I lead the Echospace group and our research projects are funded by the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
