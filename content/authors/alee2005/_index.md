Hi! I'm a senior at the University of Washington, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on embedded systems. I love the ocean - I'm a team lead at UWROV, an underwater robotics team competing in the MATE Competition annually, and I enjoy scuba diving when I get the opportunity.

I joined Echospace in the summer of 2024 and I'm excited to learn and showcase my skills. I'm currently developing a mobile weather station package with eventual near-real-time bat call detection to correlate weather data with bat calls to determine how bat activity varies with weather parameters.

Don't hesitate to reach out to me through email or through LinkedIn - I'd love to chat.
